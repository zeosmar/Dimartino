# Script Instructions

1) COINS-images2bids/COINS_BIDS_setup.py : pulls relevant information from COINS runsheet and prepares for dcm2bids
  * arguments
    * --runsheet /Path/to/COINS/runsheet
    * --keysheet /Path/to/COINS/keysheet (COINS-images2bids/COINS_run_sheet_key.csv)

    * --source_dir /Path/to/subject/source/directory 
	* --subject_list /Path/to/list/of/subjects

    * keysheet (downloaded from github)
    * model json file (downloaded from github)
    * a folder containing diicom data
	* a .txt file containing a list of subjects formatted 'sub-[subid]', one line per subject
  * output: 
    * source_dir/selected_scans.txt - contains file names of good scan runs for each subject, based on COINS sheet
    * source_dir/selected_physio.txt - contains file names of good physio data for each subject, based on COINS sheet
    * source_dir/selected_track.txt - contains file names of good tracking data for each subject, based on COINS sheet
    * source_dir/[subID]/[subID].json - contains file names of good scan runs for the subject, based on COINS sheet
    * source_dir/error_log.txt - a text file listing any subjects from the COINS sheet that did not compile correctly
      
  
2) COINS-images2bids/batch_dcm2bids.py : converts scan diicoms to nifti, outputs in BIDS format

    * destination - contains scan data organized in bids format (note: at this stage, participants with multiple sessions, e.g. sub-80084 and sub-80084b, are treated as separate subjects. They will be combined in a later step.)
    * source/error_log.txt - a text file listing any subjects from the COINS sheet that did not compile correctly
      * most common is 'subject not in source folder' - just indicates that your sub_dir did not contain diicom data for a particular subject, does not indicate malfunctioning code, does not cause a problem with the output produced from other subjects
      * this information is appended to the error log from step 1 - if a participant threw an error in step 1, they will appear a second time in this step
